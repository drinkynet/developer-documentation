Applications may use \[schema:Text\]\(https://schema.org/Text\) to provide a more general description of a location \("In Victoria Park, near the lake"\), but this is not recommended: consuming applications will be unable to help users discover opportunities based on their location.  **Example**  `{   "address": {     "addressLocality": "New Malden",     "addressRegion": "London",     "postalCode": "NW5 3DU",     "streetAddress": "Raynes Park High School, 46A West Barnes Lane",     "type": "PostalAddress"   },   "description": "Raynes Park High School in London",   "geo": {     "latitude": 51.4034423828125,     "longitude": -0.2369088977575302,     "type": "GeoCoordinates"   },   "id": "https://example.com/locations/1234ABCD",   "identifier": "1234ABCD",   "name": "Raynes Park High School",   "telephone": "01253 473934",   "type": "Place" }` |
