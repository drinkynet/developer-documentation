# Implementing booking

## Prerequisites for Open Booking API

In order to build the Open Booking API, you must first have built both [Open Opportunity Data Feeds](../publishing-data/data-feeds/), and created a [Dataset Site](../publishing-data/dataset-sites.md).

## Implementation guidance

For .NET, a full implementation tutorial is available: [https://tutorials.openactive.io/open-booking-sdk/](https://tutorials.openactive.io/open-booking-sdk/).

For other languages, it is best to use the [Open Booking API CR2](https://openactive.io/open-booking-api/EditorsDraft) specification as an implementation reference.

### .NET, PHP and Ruby Libraries

Several libraries are available that greatly simplify implementation of the Open Booking API.

The table below lists the available OpenActive libraries:
