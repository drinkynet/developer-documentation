# Overview

The path to publishing OpenActive data depends on how you're currently publishing timetable information. Shifting to open data could be as simple as simply ticking a box on a webform.

* If your Leisure Management System \(LMS\) already supports open data, probably all you need to do to start publishing is change a setting or two via its web interface. 
* If you're not  using an LMS at all, there are a number of web and software platforms available to help make publishing open data easy.

If you're not sure whether your LMS already supports open data, what LMS you're using \(or even whether you're using an LMS at all!\), get in touch with us at [hello@openactive.io,](mailto:hello@openactive.io) and we'll help advise you on your next steps.

Alternatively, if you're hoping to add open functionality to your LMS, or have bespoke needs not addressed by currently-available products, the [pages that follow ](data-feeds/)provide an introduction to the technical work needed to make open data a reality for your organisation.
