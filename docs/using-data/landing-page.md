# Using Open Active Data

\[Open Active is a programme that helps data stewards publish data about physical activity in a [standard way](../specifications/specifications-overview.md). Making it easy for data users to use, compare and combine data from different providers. \]

\[Open Active data is published by [many different providers](get-the-data.md). Developers of apps and services who want to use the provider's data will [need a database](technical-requirements.md) of their own to [synchronise with the providers](harvesting-opportunity-data.md).\]

\[If you would like more background, read this [primer](primer-introduction.md).\]
