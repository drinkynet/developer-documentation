# Using Open Active data

Open Active isn't an organisation, so it doesn't hold data itself. Open Active is a collaborative community-led initiative that helps organisations publish data about physical activity opportunities in a [standard way](../specifications/specifications-overview.md). "Opportunities" for activity include one-off _events_ such as triathlons; s_essions_ such as exercise classes, and _facilities_ such as football pitches. [Data standards](https://standards.theodi.org/) make it easier for data users to use, compare and combine data from different providers.

Data - formatted according Open Active standards - is published by [many different providers](get-the-data.md) who may specialise in different activities or regions.

Developers of apps and services who want to use a provider's data will [need a database](technical-requirements.md) of their own to [synchronise with the providers](harvesting-opportunity-data.md). But you can explore the providers' data using the [API Dashboard](https://status.openactive.io/) and investigate whether it meets your needs.
