# Overview

Because open data is data that’s available to everyone to access, use and share, you can  start using OpenActive data in your services immediately! A full list of available OpenActive data  can be found [on our status page.](http://status.openactive.io/)

If you want to display open  data on your website easily, a number of off-the-shelf solutions are available, and are listed on the [Active Choice](https://www.activechoice.org/) website. If you feel you need guidance regarding which one is most suitable to your needs, please contact us at [hello@openactive.io](mailto:hello@openactive.io).

If you don’t want to use an off-the-shelf solution and would prefer to use your own development resources, the [following pages](harvesting-opportunity-data.md) provide a quick introduction and tutorial in harvesting our data for yourself. To follow along you’ll need some existing knowledge of programming, including familiarity with HTTP, JSON, and APIs.

Can’t find the type of opportunity data you're looking for? Need some technical support? Get in touch with the OpenActive team: [hello@openactive.io](mailto:hello@openactive.io)
