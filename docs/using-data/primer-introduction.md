## Introduction

## Rationale for the architecture

\[Rationale is based on the primary usecase of having a single search experience that covers a large number of data providers and geographies. To power a search like this you either need \(a\) very fast responses from lots \(hundreds\) of endpoints that represent each database, like Google do when serving Ads or \(b\) sync and centralisation.

The latter is cheaper to implement, more robust to network failure, and easier to cache and scale.\]
